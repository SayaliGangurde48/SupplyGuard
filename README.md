🌍 SecureSupply AI – AI-Powered Supply Chain Vulnerability Assessment

🔒 Making supply chains resilient, intelligent, and future-proof.

🌐 Live Prototype:https://supply-guard-hackwave.replit.app/

✨ Overview

SecureSupply AI is an AI-driven platform that protects global supply chains by detecting vulnerabilities in ports, transportation, and security operations.
It doesn’t just alert you — it simulates ripple effects, quantifies risks in $$ and days, and recommends smart recovery strategies to keep industries like Retail, Automotive, and Healthcare running smoothly.

🔑 Key Features

🔍 Smart Vulnerability Detection → Detects customs delays, congestion, fraud, and regulatory risks.

⏱ Real-Time Monitoring → Tracks port disruptions, weather alerts, and route risks with live updates.

📊 Interactive Dashboard → Global supply chain map with active, warning, critical status.

🤖 AI-Powered Suggestions → Gemini AI recommends rerouting, pre-clearance, partial air freight, and buffer stock.

🌊 Ripple Effect Simulation → Shows how one disruption spreads across the chain.

📑 Reports & Exports → Generate PDF, Excel, JSON reports for decision-making.

🌱 Sustainable & Economical → Aligned with UN SDGs (Goal 9 & Goal 12).

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend:
⚛️ React 18 + TypeScript • 🎨 Tailwind CSS • 🧩 Radix UI + shadcn/ui • 🔄 TanStack Query • 🎥 Framer Motion • Wouter Router

Backend:
🟢 Node.js + Express.js • 📡 RESTful API (JSON) • 🗄 PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) • 🛠 Drizzle ORM • FastAPI (AI connectors)

UI/UX & Visualization:
📊 Recharts (graphs) • 🗺 Interactive World Map • 🖼 Lucide React + React Icons • 📅 React Day Picker

🚀 How It Works

Detect → AI ingests customs/security alerts, weather, FX, and event signals.

Simulate → Ripple effect shows cascading delays across ports, DCs, and sectors.

Quantify → Risk KPIs = Service-at-Risk %, Revenue-at-Risk ($), Avg Lead-time Δ.

Recommend → AI suggests resilient strategies with cost/time/risk trade-offs.

🎯 Target Audience

🏭 Manufacturers (Automotive, Electronics, Healthcare)

🚢 Logistics Providers (Shipping, Freight, 3PLs)

🏦 Insurance Companies (risk-based premiums)

🏛 Governments & Policymakers (monitor trade disruptions)
